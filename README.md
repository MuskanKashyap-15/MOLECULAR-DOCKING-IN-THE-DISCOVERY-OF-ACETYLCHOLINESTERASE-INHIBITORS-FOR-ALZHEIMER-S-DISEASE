# MOLECULAR-DOCKING-IN-THE-DISCOVERY-OF-ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE-INHIBITORS-FOR-ALZHEIMER-S-DISEASE
This repository contains a review paper focused on the use of molecular docking techniques to identify potential acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The paper discusses the disease background, role of AChE, docking methods, and recent studies involving both synthetic and natural compounds.
