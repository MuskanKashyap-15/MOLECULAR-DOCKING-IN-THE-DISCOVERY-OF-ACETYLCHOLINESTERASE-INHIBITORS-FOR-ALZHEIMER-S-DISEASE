## 🧬 Abstract

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with memory loss, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral changes. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays a critical role in the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter crucial for learning and memory. Inhibiting AChE is a validated therapeutic strategy for AD.

This review highlights the role of **molecular docking** in the discovery and design of potential AChE inhibitors. It includes discussions on synthetic and natural inhibitors, the use of docking tools like **PyRx** and **AutoDock Vina**, and visual analysis through **PyMOL** and **Discovery Studio**.
